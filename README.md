## Super Store Sales Dashboard

The dataset, generously provided by Information Technology Institute (ITI), underwent a comprehensive analysis.


## Steps were covered:

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Thorough examination for Missing and Duplicate Values.
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removal of Duplicate, blank, and irrelevant data.
3. **Data Preprocessing:**

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Development of an Interactive Dashboard featuring Key Performance Indicators, Trends, and Slicers.
